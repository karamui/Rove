# Rove

This app was created by Maggie Alberts, Sarah Learner, Kara Mui, and Jason Payne.

Rove is a single-page web application that finds relevant travel and tourism information about a city of the user's choosing. It utilizes multiple public API's to retrieve any data that a user may want to know about a city, such as what language is spoken there, what currency is used, what the weather is like, what the most popular attractions are, and what events are happening in the city.

To use the app, simply input the name of the city you'd like to visit into the search bar and take a look at all the exciting things happening there.

Our application can be viewed on [GitHub](https://karamui.github.io/Rove/).
